The seating is great, with professional waiters and waitresses. My boyfriend and I went to this place to have a taste of their famous Peking Duck, and the dish turned out to be really amazing! I like how they came to your desk and serve directly to your plate for the first round, and the second round comes out very quickly too. The shrimp dumplings are great too, much better than the usual ones you may get at a Dim Sun place. Of course the price is a bit higher too. ")

My only issue is cost...beer is like 8 bucks and they did not have my favorite the night I was there and it's was a Saturday night. Look I know this is not Chicago...I should not hold them to that standard but dang....Chinese bar should have Tsingtao coming out of their ears on Saturdays. ")
